discussed how to make service call by POST data 

created a form where the user can add data and fetched the data to pass it as parameters to the function

fetched data from input box using event binding like (change), (input)

assigning input data to variable using functions and without using functions

(change) = "variablename = $event.target.value"
or
(change / input) = "functionname($event.target.value)"

also printed the response from post data received from server
