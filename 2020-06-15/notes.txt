These are some steps and important links for you to help with the topics we have discussed in today's session

discussed about structuring the taskboard for BPM project with sidebar and on the right column, add 4 cards of equal size and within each card use either bootstrap card or alert component to clone the ui
then create a service that send you an array of objects like { titles: "sample", "body": "sample" }

also discussed about passing header to service calls (get, post) using HttpHeaders class instance and using set, get, append functions of HttpHeaders class to append each header key: value

for eTracker project, try storing the base64 image data to a database (or try storing to a global variable) and then create get method (or pass the variable via routing) to retrieve the same to display the image dynamically in the next page (routing) 

about setting the login component for Auth-E project how to display the first component as login and then add another component with header, footer and router-outlet where you display your application

also read/refer about route.navigate() to route instead of routerLink to add conditions around the routing so when the login is failed (in case of wrong credentials), the routing doesn't happen.
