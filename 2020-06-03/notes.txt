These are some steps and important links for you to help with the topics we have discussed in today's session

discussed passing data from child to parent using @viewChild() decorator and ngAfterViewInit()

since the new data we picked up from child component cannot update the just initialised variable in parent component, we have used the detectChanges() of ChangeDetectorRef as a workaround (also search online to solve the issue using a different approach)

discussed how to pass data using a service class (data.service.ts)

used BehaviourClass from Rxjs to broadcast data and access/subscribe the data from different/any component across the project src

we will discuss how to make service calls using this service class we have created in today's session then use HttpClient

Please try to practice Rxjs library components as much as possible

Here are some useful docs to get started:
https://rxjs-dev.firebaseapp.com/guide/overview 
https://rxjs-dev.firebaseapp.com/api/index/class/BehaviorSubject 
https://angular.io/guide/rx-library

Also, please keep in touch in case you have any queries regarding the concepts discussed in any session so far.
