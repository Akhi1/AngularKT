These are some steps and important links for you to help with the topics we have discussed in today's session

discussed routing using the Router module that angular has to offer

for this we add (click) event binding for a button as follows

	<button [disabled]='twoWay.length>10' (click)="routeMe(twoWay)">Click me!</button>

then within the componet.ts file we import the Router module

	import { Router } from '@angular/router';

and we call the navigate() function of Router module within routeMe() custom function

    this.route.navigate(['/employees',data]

discussed different syntax of ngStyle and ngClass i.e., [style] and [class]

creating components (nested) as parent and child and nesting child within the parent component

passed data to child from parent component using @Input() decorator

passed data from child to parent component using @Output() decorator and EventEmitter class

will discuss about data passing/communication between sibling components (tomorrow session)

will discuss about creating service class and making REST api calls (tomorrow session)
