captured the configuration variable like apiUrl to service files and loaded them dynamically

used ng build --enviroment=yourenvname to build the project and create dist folder components

discussed how to install and setup apache tomcat server locally and 
how to copy the build files to ROOT directly and run the server using startup.bat file

paste the dist folder files to ROOT folder and run the server to see your application running locally on localhost:8080
