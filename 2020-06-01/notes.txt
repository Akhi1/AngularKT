Hello guys,

These are some steps and important links for you to help with the topics we have discussed in today's session

discussed on how to send and retrieve multiple data variables through routing uri params and capture them and store in separate variables

created a simple web application using the static studentdata provided in earlier session with the following components flow

departments (list of departments in data) > sections (list of sections department wise) > list (list of students based on department  and section passed) > details (details card including individual student data from the studentid received from previous component route)

app-routing.ts
  { path: 'departments', component: DepartmentsComponent },
  { path: 'sections', component: SectionsComponent },
  { path: 'sections/:dept', component: SectionsComponent },
  { path: 'list', component: ListComponent },
  { path: 'list/:dept/:sec', component: ListComponent },
  { path: 'details', component: DetailsComponent },
  { path: 'details/:id', component: DetailsComponent }

different syntax used for routerLink on button click
 routerLink="/details/{{item.studentid}}"
<!-- OR -->
 [routerLink]="['/details',item.studentid]"

discussed with example on loading dynamic css properties using ngStyle
[ngStyle]="{'background-color':item.studentname.length>3?'green':'gray'}"
  discussed with example on loading dynamic css properties using ngClass (we can also load out custom class instead of bootstrap class)
[ngClass]="{'bg-primary':item.studentname.length>3, 'myClass':item.studentname.length<=3}


Also, please keep in touch in case you have any queries regarding the concepts discussed in any session so far.
